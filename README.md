# Shopping Helper

This project is a work in progress.

I wanted to expand on the [Scrimba Shopping List](https://github.com/BrianSlaby/scrimba-shopping-list) project that I made earlier in the [Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend).  The idea is for this expanded project to use a Google Firebase cloud firestore database with authentication instead of the realtime database without authentication used in the original project.  I also wanted to include the option to create multiple lists to facilitate organization, likely with checkboxes (in the original project clicking on a list item simply deleted it).

I also wanted to build this using React, to get more practice with it.
